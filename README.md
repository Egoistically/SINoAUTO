# SINoAUTO
Really low effort bot for SINoALICE (Global) based on [ALAuto](https://github.com/Egoistically/ALAuto).  
Its main purpose is to run over night, it won't solve all your problems and **it is buggy**, but it works.  
  
Requirements:
* Python 3.7.X and packages installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) added to PATH.
* BlueStacks `swipe` macro imported with hotkey set to `Ctrl + Alt + 1` (won't work if window isn't focused).

List of events:
```
- evolution_weapon [doesn't focus any specific element]
- evolution_armor
- justice
```

I don't care what you use this for, but **I take no responsibility**.
